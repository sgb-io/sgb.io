### Profile {#profile}

I'm Sam, a software engineer based in London.

The hyper-connected world we live in today means we have a unique opportunity to deliver real world value to thousands or even millions of people by deploying code onto devices and networks. I think it's a special time to be involved with the web and I'm grateful to be a part of it.

I'm passionate about what I do and having fun doing it with amazing people inspires me.

I have worked accross the stack with various technologies and have a particular interest in all things JavaScript.
